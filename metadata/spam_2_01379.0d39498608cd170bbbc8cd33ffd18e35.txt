Subject: Sitescooper: scoop websites onto your PalmPilot - Sitescooper
    automatically retrieves the stories from several news websites, trims off
    extraneous HTML, and converts them into iSilo or Palm DOC format for later
    reading on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've
    already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and
    3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very
    easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot,
    it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are
    included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat
    and Linux Today.  http://jmason.org/software/sitescooper/
